My name is Ivan Aidun (last name pronunciation: ay-DUNE, IPA: /ɛjˈdun/).  
I am a Ph.D. student in math at the [University of Wisconsin–Madison][uw-link]. My advisor is [Jordan Ellenberg][ellenberg].

I am interested in arithmetic geometry, which broadly speaking asks questions about the structure of rational number solutions to systems of multivariate polynomial equations. My thesis work is about an invariant called the "strength" of a polynomial $f$ in many variables, which is the least number $r$ so that $f$ can be written as a sum of $r$ reducible polynomials. What interests me about strength is that the statement ''$f$ has low strength'' can be viewed as a generalization of the statement ''$f$ has a rational solution'', and I am pursuing this idea by asking questions about polynomials with low strength inspired by questions people have asked about polynomials with rational solutions. A more technical description can be found on my [Research][research] page.

I am an organizer for the [UW–Madison Directed Reading Program][drp] and for the [UW–Madison AMS Student Chapter][uw-ams] (a.k.a. Donut Seminar).
